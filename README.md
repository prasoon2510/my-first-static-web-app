If you’re replicating a version of Discord, you’ll need to build the following pages:

A home page (“home”) – the first page the user will see after logging in, with a friends list and a friend chat window.
A profile settings page (“profile”) – to update the user’s profile information.
A server page (“server”) – to display channels, navigate between each of them, with a chat window to type.
A server settings page (“server_settings”) – to update the information of servers you own.
A new server page (“new”) – to create a brand new server.
A discover page (“discover”) – to explore and join public servers.
